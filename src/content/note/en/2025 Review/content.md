## Q1-Q2: Tempered by the Secular World and Sudden Epiphany

### 📉 Acceptance

At the end of November 2024, amidst the clamors, I entered the stock market.

In January 2025, I first experienced a killing silence, freezing points, and the gambler's mentality. Investments without prior consideration of profit‑taking or stop‑loss are gambling; investments without firm determination and superhuman endurance are gambling; following the crowd to chase highs and repeatedly buying in and out is gambling. In the first two months of the year, I was a complete gambler.

The expectation of returns, the unwillingness to accept heavy losses, and the urgency to break even all led to my losses worsening. In this game against myself, my only gain was seeing part of my own human nature clearly. There’s no need to romanticize it; ugly is ugly.

Impatience, unwillingness, lack of strategy, regret — the manifestations are those of a gambler, just dressed up under the more beautiful name of investment.

Afterwards, I thought and reflected a lot. Looking back now, it was actually a few factors at play.

Bubble fantasies and a loss of self‑positioning gave me the mistaken preconception that the stock market was bound to make quick money; superficial learning and following online trends made me think that I could make money as long as I applied what I learned; lack of patience and unstable resolve led me to repeatedly make wrong operations, jumping into deeper pits; high allocation magnified all emotional feedback to infinity, burying myself.

In a nutshell:

**A series of gambler behaviors triggered by a novice dreaming of increasing assets through a high proportion of investments with low savings**

Fortunately, through continuous reflection, thinking, and behavioral adjustments, I more or less closed my positions this year, or at most suffered a small loss. Investing in the secondary market, at least at my current stage, is relatively early and not very meaningful, so afterwards I greatly reduced my energy in this area, keeping only a small proportion of ETFs and a regular investment in gold.

As for future capital allocation planning, suitable investment project selection, and how to achieve compounding, I currently have no way of knowing. That’s something my future self needs to consider. I hope this year’s lesson will make my future self a bit more mindful. Those with almost zero windfall luck are exploring other paths…

`Actually I'm still quite lucky to witness such a fluctuating situation at minimal cost. Within this half year I saw the lows and highs, and realized that my ability is not enough to support my judgment of the trend. My ability is insufficient and the timing is not right.`


- [ ] 💭 Hope that three years from now I can systematically build my own financial model, with certain balancing logic to achieve positive feedback (😊 provided I have that much 💶)

### 🧣 A Glimpse After 4 Years

On May 3, 2021, after chatting with Lin, I went home and made a promise with her — that was our last meeting.

On August 11, 2023, we silently closed all channels, and any words we had for each other were pale.

On January 24, 2025, I caught sight of her again in a crowd, and my inner tsunami lasted for a long time.

In November, I went to Shenzhen to see Awei. At 2 a.m. that night, we talked about this matter. He found it very strange — obviously there wasn't a long story between us, no moments engraved in eternity, just ordinary past. Yet I had been trapped in this whirlpool for eight years, maybe even longer.

It wasn’t until this May that I truly embarked on the road to letting go. Although emotions would occasionally rebound, and I would occasionally think about what‑if scenarios, what I know is to move forward. Perhaps in next year's year‑end summary I will completely end this chapter; whether there is a new chapter or not, this prelude will eventually be turned.

Why has it lasted so long? I don’t really understand either. In these years, even if we no longer met or communicated, I could always know her thoughts and her situation in my dreams. Perhaps it’s because the story in another dimension has not ended, so this prelude of self‑monologue is so lengthy.

In any case, **this prologue of monologue should come to an end**.

### 🤕 Recurrent Illness

In March, the ligament in my left ankle tore again. I lay in bed for more than a month; the world pressed the pause button.

During the pain, I turned over past basketball footage. There was nostalgia for the youthful vigor of the past, and also a sense of desolation from my body and mind being exhausted back then.

It's only now that I am reluctantly doing rehabilitation exercises.

Recently I found tennis 🎾 to be a great sport; at least when hitting against a wall, the footwork strength required is relatively low.

- [ ]  🎾 Hope my ankle recovers next year and I slowly get rid of the greasy and decadent state

### 🕯️ A Belated Epiphany

At the end of April, my grandfather passed away.

When my grandfather was alive, in my subconscious I was still beneath my elders.

Because of my father's death and my years of study, all the family affairs were handled by my mother. My grandfather had been bedridden for years, and his condition worsened this year. When we said goodbye during the winter break, he told me it was our last meeting, but I didn’t take it to heart, because his spirit made me think it was his undue worry. It was only when I received the bad news that I belatedly realized.

The familiar scenes of keeping vigil, cremation, and burial played out once again.

When we laid him to rest and I kowtowed before the grave, I truly felt **the weight of the burden that had fallen on my shoulders**.

All the romantic ideals, like the regrets of youth that are hard to put into words and traveling ten thousand miles as a young man, have completely retreated to the back stage since then.

Going forward alone, the priority is making a living and a stable place, so that my mother and my future family will no longer be anxious and tired.

`This year both of my older female cousins married and started families. Many things changed nature in a short time; in hindsight, this may have been a catalyst for change. I hope to use these changes to firm up and temper my heart and slowly shoulder the burden.`

## Q3-Q4: Building Business Thinking and Restructuring Execution Logic

### 💻 First Job Review

At the end of May, after handling everything, I thought about where to work. When many things catch up with the schedule, there is no way to take care of them all. So I decisively gave up on attending classes and preparing for the CET‑6 exam, and threw myself into finding an internship.

Due to luck and timing, I received several offers within a week and ultimately chose to work at a start‑up agency specializing in overseas marketing, doing overseas KOL operations, and later switched to an AE execution role.

High‑density work content and high‑intensity work pressure largely changed my execution thinking and logic. From being a complete novice, to independently completing KOL content handovers, to acting as the project's PM within the company, then independently claiming projects, completing them together with a full‑time colleague, and later single‑handedly developing and being responsible for the needs of seven regions for one company — in five months, I did all these.

The improvement in learning and execution efficiency and the continuous reconstruction of project management and execution logic also brought me many problems and made me think about many issues.

Whether it's the work of a KOL or the work of an AE executor, both are fundamentally execution (this is not to say that execution is bad, but a judgment from my own planning). This has some value for me who was just starting in business. I understood the logic of running a business, the general market situation, and the necessary resources. But no matter how well business is done, it is still business; I could not grasp the core. So after training my project thinking and execution logic, it was still repetitive operations. I was constrained above by clients and below by the abilities of other colleagues, with no core capability of my own. Leaving this team, my value was almost zero. Therefore, when my value was exhausted and the internal system was chaotic and fraught with problems, I chose to resign on December 3.

Looking back now, in terms of project management, internal and external coordination, personal demeanor, and business logic, I more or less learned a lot from those above, and I also know what I lack and what I need to do. Overall, the results of these five months were relatively good, and it made me initially want to continue moving forward in the direction of going overseas.

### 🚢 The Choice and Disappointment of the Second Job

In early December, since I had decided to resign, I initially thought about taking a gap period to relax, but the day after I tendered my resignation, unemployment anxiety hit. So I hurriedly looked for the next employer. On December 5 I decided to join a new company (a brand TikTok Shop agency).

The high pressure of the three interviews made me think that the company’s talent development system was sound enough for real progress here. But after I actually joined, I realized they even hoped to find a new path from interns. The lack of a complete SOP, chaotic division of responsibilities, the contradictory mentality of wanting value output yet afraid that you learn things, and the recognition of interns doing dirty work all let me know I chose the wrong place.

With the year end approaching, I had no choice but to wait until after the new year to look for a new company and position.

I know what I lack and need, but the timing is not right and the environment is not good. This is my disappointment at the end of the year.

But perhaps the significance of this company to me is that I can accumulate economically while slowing down and thinking about the next strategies.

Maybe disappointment is an old habit of mine recurring; by slowing down like this, I was able to finish writing this summary.

## 🗻 Epilogue

Late at night, in the quiet, thinking through the year.

A lot has happened in one year. The positioning of my own humanity and the adjustments made; the reflection on past emotions and the decisiveness to end them; the positioning of my own stage and clarifying what I should be doing; the confirmation of the direction I hope for and anchoring the things I lack. Many things happened this year, even more than expected. But I always keep pushing myself to be faster and more accurate, so that the reality and the expectations always have a gap. Being mature and steady seems better than being full of youthful exuberance.

Everyone I met afterwards said I was mature; even my family and I myself feel that I have aged too quickly in these two years, unconsciously becoming a different person.

Writing up to here, I deleted words again and again, so let it end here.

Regarding mental strength and aging quickly, I have too much helplessness. So I hope that when I'm 30, I will look the same as when I am 20.

No more words; I hope next year
