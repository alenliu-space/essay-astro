Hi, this is [Alen](https://alenliu.space/).

This is my second blog, or perhaps it would be more accurate to call it my collection of writings.

My state of mind has changed, and much of my writing no longer fits the style of my previous [Blog](https://blog.alenliu.space/).  Therefore, on January 1st, 2026, I created this collection of writings.

I will be writing more medium-to-long form pieces here.

*Regarding photography, I will post my favorite photos here; the rest will be in the [Gallery](https://gallery.alenliu.space/) for safekeeping.*

*For my casual notes, I will be writing them in [Ech0](https://ech0.alenliu.space/).*

	Since my previous [Blog] holds many memories for me, I will still keep and update it. However, the focus will gradually shift to this new site.


Wishing you all the best!
